# United-Nations-Human-Development-Viz

This is a United Nations Maternal Mortality Rate data dashboard, created with United Nations Human Development data. Using maps, bar graphs, and statistical analysis, the goal of this project is to show the countries in the world that have the highest maternal mortality rates (number of moms dying during or shortly after childbirth out of 100000). The products of this project are:
1. A bar graph which is grouped into three different clusters, the countries that have the highest maternal mortality rate, the second cluster has the second highest, and the last group has the lowest rate.
This project allows the user to answer these two questions as well: 
2.  How strong is the relationship between the level of gender equality in countries to the Maternal Mortality rate?
3. How strong is the relationship between the average life expectancy of a country and the Maternal Mortality rate?

Users can see the code that was used for cleaning, preprocessing, making a map of the world using Folium, as well as Regression and KMeans Clustering.

Additional relationships between educational, gender, economic, and other metrics can be explored further if desired.

Users can obtain the raw data for the project at the United Nations Web Site
